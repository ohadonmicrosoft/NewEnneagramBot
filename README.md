# EnneaBot – Interactive Enneagram Test Results Display

EnneaBot is a modern, interactive web interface designed to display the results of an Enneagram personality test in a chat-style conversation. It leverages advanced design techniques—such as glassmorphism, smooth animations, and responsive layouts—to deliver an engaging user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Results are shown as a dynamic conversation, revealing your primary and secondary Enneagram types along with detailed descriptions.
- **Modern Visuals**: Utilizes glassmorphism effects, smooth fade-in/slide-down animations, and modern typography (via Google Fonts) for a high-end look and feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully adapts to different screen sizes and mobile devices.
- **Expandable Analysis**: A “More Info” button reveals an additional section with in‑depth analysis and practical tips.
- **Share Functionality**: A “Share Result” button enables users to easily copy the page URL and share their results.

## Demo

[Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot)  
*Replace the URL with your actual GitHub Pages address after deployment.*

## How It Works

1. **URL Parameters**:  
   The system reads two URL parameters:  
   - `type`: The primary Enneagram type (e.g., A, B, C, etc.)  
   - `secondary`: The secondary Enneagram type  
   
   **Example URL**:  
   `https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot?type=A&secondary=I`

2. **Chat Simulation**:  
   Based on the parameters, the interface “converses” with the user by sequentially displaying messages (with animations) that include:
   - A greeting
   - The primary type and its detailed description
   - The secondary type and its detailed description
   - A concluding message inviting the user to view more information

3. **Additional Analysis**:  
   When the user clicks the "More Info" button, an expandable section appears with further analysis, tips, and strategies for personal development.

4. **Sharing**:  
   A "Share Result" button copies the current page URL to the clipboard so that users can easily share their results with others.

## Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub Pages.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ennea-bot.git
   cd ennea-bot
   ```

2. **Customize (Optional)**

   - **Update Content**:  
     Modify `script.js` to change the personality type descriptions or adjust the conversation flow.
   - **Adjust Styling**:  
     Tweak `style.css` to alter the visual appearance (colors, fonts, animations, etc.) as needed.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

   - Push your repository to GitHub.
   - In your repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
   - Under "Source," select the branch (usually `main` or `master`) or folder (e.g., `/docs`) to deploy.
   - GitHub will provide a URL for your live site (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot`).

4. **Usage**

   Visit your deployed site with URL parameters—for example:  
   `https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot?type=A&secondary=I`  
   The page will read the parameters and display the corresponding results in the interactive chat interface.

## Explanation of Deployment and Testing

### Google Apps Script Side (for the Enneagram Test)
1. **Setup:**
   - Open [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and create a new project.
   - Paste your Google Apps Script code (which creates a Google Form with 90 questions, links a Google Sheet for responses, computes results, and sends an email with a link to the results page).
   - Run the `installSystem()` function, approve the necessary permissions, and check the logs for the Form and Sheet URLs.

2. **Usage:**
   - Share the Form URL with users.
   - When a user submits the form, their answers are recorded and processed. The calculated results (sums per type, primary and secondary types) are recorded in the “Calculation” sheet.
   - An email is sent to the user with a link to your GitHub Pages site (the EnneaBot frontend) that includes URL parameters (e.g., `?type=A&secondary=I`).

3. **Testing:**
   - Fill out the form with test data.
   - Verify that responses appear in the “Form Responses 1” and that the “Calculation” sheet updates correctly.
   - Confirm that the email is received and the link works.

### GitHub Pages Side (EnneaBot Frontend)
1. **Deployment:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `ennea-bot`).
   - Add the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `.gitignore`, etc.) to your repository.
   - In the repository settings under “Pages,” configure the source (typically the `main` branch).
   - GitHub will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot`).

2. **Usage:**
   - When a user clicks the link from the email (for example, `https://your-username.github.io/ennea-bot?type=A&secondary=I`), the JavaScript code reads the URL parameters.
   - The page then displays a simulated conversation (chat messages) with the details for the primary and secondary personality types.
   - Users can click “More Info” to see additional analysis and “Share Result” to copy the page URL.

3. **Testing:**
   - Visit your GitHub Pages URL with various query parameters to ensure the correct content is displayed.
   - Test the responsiveness of the site on different devices and screen sizes.
   - Interact with the “More Info” and “Share Result” buttons to confirm they work as expected.
